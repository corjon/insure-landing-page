## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Alot of practice with positioning and flexbox
- Using ::after and ::before for short horizontal lines

### Continued development

- Find out if there's a better way to layout the background images other than using ::after or ::before. The left half of the button in the intro area isn't clickable because of the left background image area overlaps it. Z-index would not fix this.

### Useful resources

- [Semrush Blog](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/) - This is a great example of how to use Semantic HTML and also how not to use it.
